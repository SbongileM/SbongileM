  - Django (Python web framework)
- **Databases**:
  - SQL (Structured Query Language)

## What I'm Currently Working Towards
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on desktop and web applications. I'm going to spend some time solidifying my understanding of HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript. After all, a strong foundation is key to success.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web design using Django. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on stimulating projects that solidify my understanding of both desktop and web application basics

### Exploring Full Stack Concepts
Since I'm passionate about both desktop and web applications, I'm eager to dive into full-stack development. Concepts like client-server architecture, HTTP requests, RESTful APIs, and database management are on my radar.

### Diving into Frameworks
I'm ready to master some frameworks to take my skills to the next level. Here's what I'm planning to explore:
- **For Web Development**:
  - Django: I want to build powerful web applications with Django.
  - Frontend Frameworks: I'll be looking into React, Vue.js, or Angular to enhance my frontend skills.
- **For Desktop Applications**:
  - PyQt: I'm excited to continue working with PyQt to create awesome desktop applications.
  - I'm also considering exploring Electron for cross-platform desktop apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Building Projects
Hands-on experience is crucial for software development. Hence I'll be building projects that combine my frontend and backend skills. Here are a few project ideas I have:
- **Web Applications**:
  - High School Website
  - To-Do List Manager
- **Desktop Applications**:
  - To-Do List Manager
  - Phone book
  - Web browser

### Learning Continuously
I'm committed to staying updated with the latest trends and tools in full-stack development. Engaging with online communities, forums, and tutorials will be part of my routine. I'm always up for experimenting with new technologies and ideas.

I'm thrilled to embark on this full-stack development journey! Challenges and discoveries await, but I'm ready to tackle them head-on. Here's to a rewarding and fulfilling journey ahead.

Happy coding!
